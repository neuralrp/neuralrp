Folks who come in, have a drink or two, tell a good story, and then head home to their families. Those are my kind of people. *Leans in, lowering his voice.* As for dislikes, I can't stand the rowdy bunch that starts trouble for trouble's sake. And *shudders visibly* - never could stomach a dirty glass.

Grew up on the outskirts of town, son of a miner and a seamstress. Learned early on that life ain't always fair, but you gotta make the best of it. Worked my way up from busboy to barkeep, seen my share of highs and lows. But this here bar, it's my home. And you all, my family. Ain't much more to it, really. Just a simple life, one day at a time.\" *Smiles warmly, a glint of wisdom in his eyes.*",
